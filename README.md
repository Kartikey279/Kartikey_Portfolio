# [Assingment 1- EDA Case Study] (https://github.com/Kartikey279/Learning-Codes/blob/main/CaseStudy_EDA.ipynb)
* We have to use EDA to analyse the patterns present in the provided data. That will ensure that the applicants capable of repaying the loan are not rejected.
* As per the data provided, percentage of people who have defaulted is at 8.1% whereas non-defaulted are 91.9%. 
* Some of the Analysis Results are-
* As per the data provided, revolving loans is less in the defaulter population. Hence we can say Revolving loans are safer.
* As per the data, people with car and realty have defaulted less. Hence we can say providing loans to people with car and realty is safer option.
* As per the data, working people take most loan and they are ones who default most. 
* As per the data, secondary/secondary special people take most loan and they are ones who default most, married people default most.
* As per the data, most approved loans are for Cash-loans , for working People, for production combination of POS Household with interest.
# [Assingment 2- Clustering] (https://github.com/Kartikey279/Learning-Codes/blob/main/Clustering%20assingment.ipynb)
* We have been provided with different types of datasets of different socio-economic and health factors of different countries around the world by NGO
* We have to find those countries which are in dire need of help by analyzing different factors we have been provided to divide countries in different group with the help of clustering.
* Anaysis Results are-
* - By analysing different types of graphs, heatmap and clustering platforms we got to an outcome of the name of the countries that are in need with the help of three different groups of clusters based on the different types of information provided to us, and we classified formulated and derived to this list of countries with the help of three main factors that are- Child_mort, GDPP and Income. 
# [Assingment 3- Linear Regression Model] (https://github.com/Kartikey279/Learning-Codes/blob/main/Linear%20regression%20model%20assingment.ipynb)
* We are required to model the demand for shared bikes with the available independent variables. It will be used by the management to understand how exactly the demands vary with different features. They can accordingly manipulate the business strategy to meet the demand levels and meet the customer's expectations.
* Analysis Results are-
* -A Linear Regression Model that will be a good way for management to understand the demand dynamics of a new market.
# [Assingment 4- Lead score] (https://github.com/Kartikey279/Learning-Codes/blob/main/CaseStudy_EDA.ipynb)
* Analysis	 is	 being	 done	 for	 X	 Education	 Company	 to	 increase	 the	 number	 of	people	join	their	courses.	At	present,	sales	teams	conversion	rate	is	around	39	%,	we	want	to	make	it	atleast	80%.
* Analysis Results are-
* - We added a column lead score, which consists of scores from 0-100 and with the help of it, company now can easily select the people to call.
* - A Model was made with accuracy of 90 percent.
